Knockout
===============================================================================

This assembly provides access to Knockout APIs. This is only meant for use at
development time, so you can reference and compile your c# code against the
Knockout APIs. You must include the appropriate Knockout scripts in your page for
runtime functionality.

More information is on http://knockoutjs.com/ and
